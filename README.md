# Sea-Level-Rise-Visualization-Words
This project presents the change in sea levels of nine main countries approximately one from each continent (Canada, Solomon Islands, Brazil, Egypt, UAE, India, France, Australia, Barbados) ever year from 1993-2024 using only words. It uses annual data from the US Gouvernment (https://earth.gov/sealevel/sea-level-explorer/) corresponding to each year from 1993-2023. 

# How to use it?
1. Click the 'previous' and 'next' buttons to move through the years.

# Note
- The text below the year display changes every year. The text describes the situation of each year and includes facts about the pressing issue of rising sea levels. The text is generated using the RiTa.js (https://rednoise.org/rita/) method .markov(). 
- WordNik API (https://developer.wordnik.com/docs#/) is used to fetch words that symbolize each of the countries. The words for each of the nine countries are rearranged in a symbolic shape pertaining to each country.
- The word shapes increase in size if there was a sea level rise and decrease in size if there was a sea level drop when compared to the previous year.
